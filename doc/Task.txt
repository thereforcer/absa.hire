ğŸ‘‰ Create a class library (C# / Python) for conversion of quantities between different units. The library should provide conversions between units of length (meters, feet, inches), units of data (bits or bytes) and temperature (celsius , fahrenheit) out of the box. The library must support commonly used SI prefixes.

ğŸ‘‰ The library must be easily extensible so that conversions of units of other measures (like volume - liter, cubicinch, pint) could be added by someone else in the future.

* API must provide functions that take text input with some kind of simplified syntax (ignore plural / singular difference for example).
* Example input  (from X units, to target unit)-> output:
    ("1 meter", "feet") -> "3.28 feet"
    ("3 kiloinches", "meter") -> "76.19 meter"

ğŸ‘‰ Input / output are not defined strictly. We don't care about 100% correct english grammar (like correct plural / singular form ï¿½ "2 inch" is OK). It is up to candidate to come up with some reasonable syntax rules.

ğŸ“ŒğŸ“ŒğŸ“Œ Couple of criteria and hints: ğŸ“ŒğŸ“ŒğŸ“Œ

ğŸ‘‰ Solution must be in production quality. Fellow programmer doing changes to your code must feel safe not to break it accidentally.
ğŸ‘‰ Important factor is flexibility and code clarity! 
ğŸ‘‰ Don't over-engineer but don't under-engineer
